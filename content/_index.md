          The <strong>BOLT Research Group</strong> (Blockchain, Optimized Network, Ledger, Trust) focuses on building secure, high-performance distributed systems, spanning cybersecurity, blockchain technology, computer networks, and algorithmic techniques. Our work includes cryptographic protocols, P2P networks, source integrity, and trust in distributed environments. The name <strong>BOLT</strong> also reflects our recent research on the <strong>Bitcoin Lightning Network</strong>, emphasizing fast, scalable, and secure payment channels. Recently, the group has been exploring advanced techniques such as <strong>Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</strong> and <strong>Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</strong>, two critical pillars of the evolving <strong>Web3</strong> landscape. By combining foundational networking technologies with blockchain-based trust mechanisms, the group aims to advance both theoretical and practical solutions for secure distributed systems.
